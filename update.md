# Future Updates

## Small fixes

- Random server names on plugin first start to avoid conflicts.
- add automatic comment above entity tiers in config to explain owned, animal and everything
- Players with special permissions should always be able to transport items and entities of all kinds (separate permissions for both cases)
- Make all user facing messages configureable (but NOT the help menus only everything else)
