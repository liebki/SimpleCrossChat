Configuration
Easy to set up: just drop the plugin in your folder, configure your broker and server name, and you're ready to go! Advanced options allow you to customize message formats, debug output, and more.

FAQ
- Who is this for? Any Minecraft admin who wants seamless cross-server communication and data transfer.
- Is it secure? Yes, messages are encrypted and you can host your own broker.
- Is setup easy? Yes, plug-and-play with simple config options.

Version Compatibility
Old to new Minecraft versions: Transfers work most often without problems, as newer versions can read and upgrade legacy data formats for entities and items.
New to old Minecraft versions: Transfers are basically not reliable due to NBT/data differences—items usually fail, but some entities may work if their type and properties exist in both versions.
Same version: Transfers between servers running the same Minecraft version work as expected.
